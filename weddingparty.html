              <h3>Andrew &amp; Annie</h3>
              <p>We had our first date hiking at Monrovia Canyon Park in 2014. After a few more hikes, beach trips, movies, and delicious meals. we knew our lives were more fun with each other in them. Andrew proposed to Annie in December 2018 in a special location on the same hike, where it all began. We are both excited to have found a partner with whom we can take on all of life's adventures. <br>
                <br>
                We are so excited to celebrate with all of you, as we move into this next chapter of our lives.</p>

              <h2 class="text-black font-weight-light mb-4">Dayna</h2>
              <p class="mb-4">Dayna and I met at La Salle High School and became close friends during our junior year. We were fast friends, bonding over our favorite band, Bowling for Soup. We’ve been to countless concerts together and have had many other adventures together too. In 2018, we took an impromptu trip to Spain with our mutual friend, Celina! Dayna is a thoughtful, beautiful, and determined woman. She is also an incredibly gifted artist. I am very lucky to call her my friend and maid of honor. </p>

              <h2 class="text-black font-weight-light mb-4">Angela</h2>
              <p class="mb-4">Angela and I met through our sorority at CSULB. Because we had the same “big sister,” we found ourselves grouped together often and quickly became friends. Angela is one of the wittiest, strongest people I’ve ever met. She has such a good heart and a great sense of humor. Angela enjoys volunteering and has adopted a few rescue animals, including a perfect, little, three-legged gentleman named Chester. </p>

              <p class="mb-4">Lauren and I became best friends in elementary school.  Over the years, Lauren’s house became a second home to me. I would often tag-along with Lauren on family trips to museums and theme parks, and she often came swimming at my grandpa’s house or boating at Lake Pyramid. When we were teenagers, we took music lessons together.  Lauren is clever, unabashed and fun.  She is currently attending law school at LMU.

                <p class="mb-4">Talin and I met in 2014, one year before she married my brother Steven. Talin is intelligent, loyal, and a lot of fun to hang out with. She and I both consider family to be the most important thing in life. She is the mother of three wonderful children: Ayla (14), Ayden (11), and Ayva (3). Talin has a keen eye for style and design. Her house is impeccably decorated and she knows how to throw a terrific party. Talin makes my brother very happy and is a wonderful sister-in-law. </p>

                <p class="mb-4">Briana and I met in 2006 when she and my brother Peter were first becoming friends. Over the years, we have gotten to know each other during trips to the lake, concerts, snowboarding trips, and of course, Peter’s house parties. In 2017, Briana and Peter tied the knot! Bri and I share a mutual love of dogs. She and Peter own three “sweetie dogs”: Bandit, Bonnie, and Clyde. Briana is sharp, stylish, and quietly great. She has been a wonderful addition to our family. </p>

                <p class="mb-4">One of my best friends, I've known Jamie for almost all my life. We met working as lifeguards in Lakewood when we were teenagers. We've been through so many adventures together, getting into trouble everywhere we've gone. He is a highschool Vice Principal, coach, and he is the most dedicated, kind, and caring person I know. I couldnt imagine anyone else as my best man. </p>

                <p class="mb-4">I met Brandon while lifeguarding in Lakewood. Brandon is one-of-a-kind. I can say without a doubt my life would not be the same without him in it. We've taken lots of trips together including a few years where we went snowboarding almost every day of the season. </p>

                <h2 class="text-black font-weight-light mb-4">Aaron</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">I met Aaron in college while taking beach volleyball classes. Aaron worked on campus and hooked it up with free snacks, hotdogs, and giant bags of popcorn! We quickly started playing beach volleyball and hanging out outside of class together. He's an extremely talented artist. We've hiked practically every trail in the Sierra Madre Mountains. He is the reason I have seen live sumo wrestling for 4 years running now. </p>

                <p class="mb-4">James and I met in high school on the swim and waterpolo team. We also lifeguarded together, and after work most nights, we went to Disneyland. James is a skilled, professional nurse. I know this is supposed to be about James & me, but he has had two of the best dogs ever, Sandy & Cooper. They're both awesome and I wanted to send a shoutout to them.</p>
